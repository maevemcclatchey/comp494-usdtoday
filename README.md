# Installing Cocoapods and running
How to install + run
In your Xcode project, pull from develop.

Open terminal (Command + Space, then search for "terminal").

cd into the same directory as where your code for Cheers is stored.

For example, if my code is on the Desktop, then I'll need to use cd Desktop/Cheers.

Use the following commands to install CocoaPods:

sudo gem install cocoapods

pod setup <-- this is a big file, it may take a few minutes

pod install

Once the installation has finished, quit Xcode.

Open Cheers in Finder. In your Cheers folder you should see two Xcode files, a blue one that ends in .xcodeproj and a white one that ends in .xcworkspace. Double click on the white .xcworkspace file to open the project (you'll have to use white icon from now on).

Command + R to build and run!
